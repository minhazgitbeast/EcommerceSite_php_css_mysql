Registration System:
New users can create an account using the registration page (register.php).
Captures essential details like username, email, and password.
Ensures data security by hashing passwords before storage.
Session Management:
Upon successful login, user data (e.g., user_id and username) is stored in sessions for personalized access.
A "Logout" feature allows users to terminate their sessions.
2. Product Listing
Static Product Data:
